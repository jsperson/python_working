Tiber AutoML Application

Browser-driven dashboard built with Dash/Plotly.

To run, navigate to "App" and run "python index.py".

All .py files needed for running are in 'Pages' subdirectory. 'dashboard data' will populate with source data needed
to run the dashboard.

.gitignore file automatically ignores data files (like .csv) - we should keep these locally, not on git. These files
will auto-generate when you run the model.
